## School Assignment Overview

This school assignment focuses on refactoring code from the initial commit titled **"Initial Commit,"** made on 2024-07-01. 
The provided code, intentionally filled with code smells, implements the game **"Moo,"** a Mastermind-like game where the goal 
is to guess a randomized four-digit string with unique digits in as few guesses as possible.

### Assignment Objectives

**Pass Grade:**
- **Refactor the Program:** Identify and minimize or eliminate code smells.
- **Make Code Testable:** Ensure that code parts are testable for unit testing.

- **Final Result:** Review the commit titled **"Update CalculateDisplayDimensions method with detailed comments"** made on 2024-08-16 for the refactored code.

**Distinction Grade:**
- **Refactor and Extend:** Modify the program to support additional similar games, such as MasterMind, where digits can repeat.
- **Scoreboards:** Implement separate scoreboards for each game, with a shared player table across games.
- **Create Additional Games:** Add at least one new game variant.
- **Design Considerations:** 
  - Use design patterns like the Strategy Pattern for flexibility.
  - Ensure that the new implementation follows clean code standards.
  - Optionally, add a menu to select different games.
